# Django based To-Do

![django todo app](django-todo-app.png)

The best project to help learn a new development framework is a `To-Do` application.
It helps to practice the **CRUD** operations:

- _C_ -> create an item
- _R_ -> read/view the item
- _U_ -> update the item
- _D_ -> delete the item
